In each iteration we check if both the numbers perfectly divide our number. If so we store the number as L.C.M. and break from the loop. Otherwise the number is incremented by 1 and the loop continues.

The above program is slower to run. We can make it more efficient by using the fact that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of the least common multiple and greatest common divisor of those two numbers.
